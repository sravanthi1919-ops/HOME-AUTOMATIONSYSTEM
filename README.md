In the rapidly evolving world of smart technology, home automation systems are becoming increasingly significant in enhancing user convenience, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable living. The goal of this project is to develop a working prototype of a home automation system capable of controlling multiple electrical appliances—specifically a light and a fan—using both physical buttons and app-based commands. This prototype will be simulated entirely using the Tinkercad platform, which provides a powerful virtual environment for circuit design and code testing without the need for physical hardware. This not only ensures accessibility but also helps bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, especially for individuals who do not have immediate access to physical Arduino components.

The system is built around the Arduino Uno microcontroller, a versatile and widely used platform for embedded system development. Two pushbuttons are employed as manual input devices to control the on/off states of a light and a fan, which are represented by LEDs in the simulation. Each button is connected to a specific digital input pin on the Arduino, and the system is programmed to detect button presses and toggle the respective device accordingly. To ensure reliable detection, pull-down resistors are incorporated in the button circuits, which help maintain a stable LOW signal when the buttons are not pressed.

In addition to the physical controls, the system is also designed to accept remote commands, mimicking the behavior of an IoT-enabled smart home setup. This is achieved through simulated serial communication, where commands like "ON1", "OFF1", "ON2", and "OFF2" can be sent to the Arduino to control the light and fan. This dual-mode control system showcases how real-world smart home devices often support both manual and app-based interactions. The Arduino code is carefully structured to handle both input methods without conflict, ensuring seamless operation whether a device is toggled via button press or app command.

The prototype was implemented and tested on Tinkercad, which allowed for quick design, wiring, and verification of the system logic. The virtual environment offers an intuitive interface where components like LEDs, pushbuttons, resistors, and the Arduino can be placed on a breadboard, connected via wires, and programmed in real-time. This eliminates the need for physical components and provides immediate feedback, making it an ideal platform for students, hobbyists, and early-stage developers to validate their ideas.

This project successfully demonstrates the basic principles of home automation using a microcontroller-based system and introduces essential concepts such as digital input/output handling, debouncing, state toggling, and serial communication. It also serves as a foundation for more advanced implementations involving wireless communication protocols like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or MQTT, which are common in commercial smart home devices. By integrating both tactile and remote control capabilities, this prototype effectively simulates how modern IoT-based appliances can be managed, making everyday living more convenient and intelligent.

Overall, the project offers a hands-on experience in building a functional automation system, enhances understanding of embedded programming, and reinforces circuit design skills—all within the convenience and safety of a virtual simulation environment.
